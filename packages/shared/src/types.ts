 * ScriptMaker lives in the .team VIDEO LIBRARY, anchored to the specific

 * translator; that framing was drift). It fires two ways: a per-card
 * "who can use this?" button and an auto-prompt when the BA finishes a
 * product video. It produces a DRAFT invitation message anchored to that
 * product, then hands the draft into the existing /invitations form via
 * the seed + source='scriptmaker' seam (Chat #120). It does NOT mint the
 * token, create the prospect, or send anything â€” those stay in the spine.
 *
 * Prospect-surfacing ("who do you know") is IVORY's job (its own surface,
 * next session). This session ScriptMaker drafts only; the BA names the
 * prospect, ScriptMaker writes the product-anchored message. When Ivory
 * ships it routes a surfaced name into this same draft step. One engine,
 * multiple front doors (Chat #118).
 *
 * Compliance (locked-spec 3.11 script-time enforcement + 3.10):
 *   The draft is BA-composed outbound word-of-mouth, but the compliance
 *   frame still binds what the LLM may write â€” NO income claims, NO
 *   earnings projections, NO placement/queue promises, NO comp/cycle/rank
 *   math, NO medical or weight-loss guarantees. The system prefix in
 *   domain/scriptmaker.ts encodes these as hard rules; the model is
 *   instructed to refuse and fall back to a neutral product mention rather
 *   than produce a violating draft. The four G.7 invitation locks (real
 *   human contact precedes the link, no automated send, no mass send, no
 *   income content in a prospect-facing draft) attach at the send step in
